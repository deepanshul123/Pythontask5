Observation and Summary of Visualizations
In this exploratory data analysis (EDA), I examined key passenger attributes from the Titanic dataset using Matplotlib visualizations. The goal was to uncover patterns and insights that could help understand the passenger demographics and potential survival outcomes.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Passenger Class Distribution (Pclass)
The majority of passengers traveled in 3rd class.

1st class passengers formed the smallest group.

Insight: The Titanic carried a large number of lower-class passengers, likely due to affordability. Class may correlate with survival chances.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Gender Distribution (Sex)
There were more male passengers than female passengers.

Insight: The gender imbalance suggests that survival rates may need to be analyzed carefully, as Titanic's evacuation prioritized women and children.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Age Distribution (Age Histogram)
Most passengers were aged between 20 to 40 years.

There was also a noticeable number of children and elderly passengers.

Insight: The age distribution shows a predominantly young adult passenger group, with age likely affecting survival outcomes due to evacuation priorities.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Fare Distribution (Fare Histogram)
The fare distribution was highly right-skewed ‚Äî most passengers paid lower fares, while a small number paid significantly higher fares.

Insight: A few wealthy passengers paid luxury-class fares, but the majority belonged to lower socioeconomic classes.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Embarked Port Distribution (Embarked)
Most passengers boarded at Southampton (S), followed by Cherbourg (C) and Queenstown (Q).

Insight: The boarding port distribution reflects the ship's route and boarding policies, and may be linked to class and survival patterns.

üåü Overall Summary:
Through this visual and statistical exploration, several patterns emerged:

‚úÖ Titanic carried a large number of lower-class passengers.
‚úÖ Males were the majority onboard, though evacuation policies favored females and children.
‚úÖ Young adults made up the largest age group.
‚úÖ Fare distribution reveals a highly unequal socioeconomic profile.
‚úÖ Most passengers boarded at Southampton, the ship‚Äôs main embarkation point.
